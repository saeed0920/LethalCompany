## Introduction

Git is a powerful version control system that allows you to track changes in your code and collaborate with others. Two fundamental operations in Git are **pushing** and **pulling** changes. Pushing involves sending your local changes to a remote repository, while pulling is about fetching changes from a remote repository to your local machine.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Git installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Clone the Repository

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/learn-git-push-pull.git
   ```

2. Push Changes
   Once you've made your changes and are ready to share them with others, follow these steps:

```
git add .
```

Commit your changes:

```
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```

Push your changes to the remote repository:

```
git push origin main
```

3. Pull Changes
   If there are new changes in the remote repository that you want to incorporate into your local branch, follow these steps:

Switch to the branch you want to update:

```
git checkout main
```

Pull changes from the remote repository:

```
git pull origin main
```
